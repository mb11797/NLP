So far any references I have seen\\nhave been weasel-words (\"more plans in the future, etc\"), but nothing\\nthat could be taken as a \"NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)\".  I\\nhave heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has\\nlanguage that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard\\nall systems \\'unapproved\\' for public use, like strong cryptosystems\\nnot trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys\\nwhich one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by\\nfolks with \\'special\\' connections, or government agencies) as either\\n\\'terrorist tools\\' or \\'drug dealers tools\\'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY\\nbut by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY\\noutlawed for all intents and purposes.\\n\\nNow, for some idle speculation ... for those who don\\'t care, hit \\'n\\' now.\\n\\nCrypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY\\noutlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,\\nscrewdrivers, and such can be regarded as \\'burglar tools\\' pretty much\\nat the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual\\npossessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine\\nuse of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no \\'legitimate need\\'\\n(gov\\'t definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\\nusing them, might find themselves in possession of \\'terrorist tools\\'.\\nIn other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\\nsensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed\\'s opinion) strong\\nsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\\nnot personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\\nA personal desire for \\'privacy\\' most certainly will not be regarded as\\na \\'legitimate NEED\\': \\n\"Why do you want such strong security, especially from \\'legitimate law\\nenforcement\\'? An individual with \\'legitimate\\' endeavors would not be so\\nconcerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal\\nsecrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning\\nto conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING\\nTO HIDE, HMMMM?\"\\nI expect that initially there will be some people selected either at\\nrandom, or who happen to have been \\'troublemakers\\' for the purposes of\\n\\'making an example\\' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about\\nthis... (mega \\':-(\\'s)\\n\\nOne asking about a \\'right\\' to privacy will probably get a response that\\nthere is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an\\nargument used in the abortion debate):  \"You do NOT have a right to have\\nsecurity that \\'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break\\'\" (as suggested\\nin the Clipper Press Release).\\n\\nThis, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only\\nfor crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,\\nlaying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both\\nsafe-deposit box keys - \\'master\\' keys or combinations for privately\\nowned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...\\n\\nI cannot think of a better way to make an \\'end-run\\' around those\\n\\'inconvenient\\' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily\\ndeclared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would\\nsimply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A\\nsimple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are\\nmainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents\\nwould go something like:\\n\\n\"We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank\\naccount, (you don\\'t have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you\\nhave a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your\\nacquisition, transport, and use of \\'terrorist tools\\' and/or \\'drug dealers\\ntools\\' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no\\ndecent American Subject would be against these noble causes...\".\\n\\n\"Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying\\nyour HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing\\nSOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these \\'terrorist tools\\'.\\nOnly a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ...

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner\\'s manual:\\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\\n    panning for each voice\\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\\n    access to all eight voices\\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \\n    modulation sources and routings.\\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\\n    the SQ-80.\\n\\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\\n\\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\\nto use so I have avoided it.\\n\\nREASON FOR SALE:\\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\\n\\nPRICING AND TERMS:\\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \\npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \\noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner\\'s manual.\\n\\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The main reason is that\\ngood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)\\nare rarely regular DH\\'s, even if they can\\'t field; it\\'s more commonly a\\nplace to put aging veterans.\\n\\nAnother use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury\\nslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the\\nfield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH\\'s than they did\\nduring the rest of the season.\\n\\nA third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first\\nor the outfield don\\'t hit as well as DH\\'s for some reason.  Reggie\\nJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he\\nhit like the old Reggie when he was in right.\\n\\nThe second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by\\ntheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60\\nat DH will count only in the right fielders\\' averages.\\n\\n> \\tA logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement\\n> value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

This\\n> would let us \"discount\" the time they spend playing DH, because that\\n> forces the team to find another real fielder to play.\\n\\nThis makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the\\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job\\nanywhere, then you certainly can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\\n\\n\\n--\\nDavid Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu\\n\"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.\"\\n\"Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.\"\\nDisclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.\\n',\n",

A \\nplayer\\'s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\\nA player\\'s ability to walk or infielder\\'s Defensive Average are correlated\\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they\\'ll do next year.  Put in \\nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand \\n>>\\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three\\n>>\\tis a VERY clutch hit.

It was a bit shorter\\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\\nbare-bones.\\n\\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\\nin.\\n\\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\\n\\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \\n\\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\\n\\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\\npart first.\\n\\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\\n\\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \\nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\\nthis point.\\n\\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \\nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\\nto persue work on their own.\\n\\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.

Larson, 1984, North \\n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \\n          hardcover. \\n          \\n\\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \\n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \\n          \\n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \\n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \\n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \\n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \\n          \\n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \\n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \\n          validity. \\n          \\n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \\n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \\n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \\n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \\n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \\n          they contain. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \\n          portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n          \\n                                   Robert E.

(email: fw@world.std.com)\\nMy thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\\nOracle Corp.\\n\\nThe most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \\nfeatures or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\\nincluded suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \\nuse table views to refine the granularity of access control.\\n\\nOne important security consideration in networked installations\\nis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\\nauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \\n_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \\nnot define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \\nof OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \\nservers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\\noption), while relying on host security for local processes. \\n\\nInternally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \\naudit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\\ndata access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\\nrisks from within the Oracle environment.\\n\\nOracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\\nencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\\nto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \\nsince the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \\nchoose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \\nto your oracle database files through the host operating system, \\ns/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \\ncryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\\n\\nAs security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\\nCertainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\\ns/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \\nthe passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\\nalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\\nwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\\nprovides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \\nguessable. \\n\\nAs with all computer security, the most important defense is to \\neducate users in the safe choice of passwords.

Many different observations, including IRAS\\n> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures\\n> can range from 40K to 150K.\\n\\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\\nAllen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\\ncooked if that were the case.

Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\n>with others on this topic.

Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\n>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\n>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\n>basis? \\n\\nThen we would have something useful.

I would\\nhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s\\nAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or\\nbuilding the DC-Y.\\n\\nI\\'m sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any\\nexpansion of astronautics.  I don\\'t see a realistic  prospect for\\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\\nthe DC flops, it\\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\\nprospect too depressing to bear.\\n\\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\\ndirection.  It doesn\\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It\\'s creating its own market for\\nsmall payloads.)\\n\\nI read the magazines and I\\'ve attended the last two IAFs. There are\\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\\nof them as good as or better than SSTO.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\\n\\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \\noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\\nrecently rare power with their bats.\\n\\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \\nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \\nlater score on Reggie Sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \\nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\\nTom Prince\\'s two-base passed ball.  \\n\\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \\nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \\nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K\\'d\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\\n\\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\\nwork.\\n\\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \\nbruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for \"precautionary\\nX-rays\".

And of\\ncourse, they are 10-3.\\n\",\n",

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

I used to think this was true, but more and more I\\'m becoming\\nconvinced that it\\'s the other way around: among players with the physical\\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\\nchance to do it a lot.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPower\\t\\t\\tNo Power\\n\\n\\tPatient\\t\\tFrank Thomas\\t\\tBrett Butler\\n\\t\\t\\tBarry Bonds\\t\\tOzzie Smith\\n\\t\\t\\tMark McGwire\\t\\tCraig Grebeck\\n\\t\\t\\tBabe Ruth\\t\\tMiller Huggins\\n\\t\\t\\tTed Williams\\t\\tBilly Hamilton\\n\\t\\t\\tRickey Henderson\\tEddie Joost\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Morgan\\t\\tMike Hargrove\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\n\\tImpatient\\tErnie Banks\\t\\tOzzie Guillen\\n\\t\\t\\tDave Kingman\\t\\tShawon Dunston\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Carter\\t\\tAndres Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tGeorge Bell\\t\\tJose Lind\\n\\t\\t\\tKirby Puckett\\t\\tDevon White\\n\\tetc.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \\ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\\nhe\\'s only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n   David M.

I\\'ll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it\\'s a\\nbit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the\\nprotocol that\\'s followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a\\nwiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption\\nand the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is\\nsent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The\\nF-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the\\nencrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1\\nand U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.\\n\\nNote how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the\\ncops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can\\'t read other traffic.  Every\\nrequest must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The\\ncops and the FBI together can\\'t cheat, since they don\\'t have U.  (I\\nregard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the\\nsystem.  It\\'s to prevent this that I modified Alvarez\\'s scheme.)  The\\nescrow agents can\\'t read the conversation, since they don\\'t have it;\\nall they have is N and U[K].  And the police don\\'t even see N.\\n\\nIt\\'s harder to see how to block decryption of old, warrantless,\\nwiretaps.  There is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrow\\nagents that the call is current.  But that\\'s not nearly as strong.\\nThere are approaches I can see that might work, involving sequences of\\ndata on an unalterable medium, complete with cryptographic protection\\nagainst insertion onto a new medium.  But I don\\'t have anything yet\\nthat isn\\'t too complex for comfort, or too hard to install in the real\\nworld.

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)\\n\\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \\nspeed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have \\na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best\\noverall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more\\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\\nto an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach\\nhustle.\\n\\nAll that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term\\ncontract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible\\nin 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and\\nlimitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35\\nas a ML ballplayer.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\n\\n- end -\\n     \\n',\n",

The loop\\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\\n    were only visible in the low horizont.

Brown\\nSecretary\\nDepartment of Commerce\\n14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW\\nWashington, DC 20236\\n\\nDear Secretary Brown:\\n\\n   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy \\nand security of telecommunications transmissions and data in \\na networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the \\nAdministration\\'s endorsement of an electronic encryption \\nstandard, based upon \"clipper chip\" technology, have raised a \\nnumber of related issues.  The international competitiveness \\nof U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is \\na key factor that the government should consider when \\naddressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the \\nnation moves forward in developing the national \\ncommunications and information infrastructure, security of \\ntelecommunications transmissions and network data will be an \\nincreasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of \\nusers.\\n\\n   The \"hacker\" community can compromise the integrity of \\ntelecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the \\nnetwork.  The people and businesses that use the nation\\'s \\ntelecommunications network and the personal computers linked \\nthrough it increasingly are demanding that information be \\nprotected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.\\n\\n   I am concerned that the Administration\\'s plan may mean \\nthat to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies \\nwould be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. \\ngovernment customers, and another for private, commercial \\nusers who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may \\ninadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping \\nto serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee\\'s analysis \\nof this issue, please respond to the following questions:\\n\\n1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the \\nAdministration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST \\nor the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the \\nnature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any \\nplans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how \\nsuch experts will be chosen.\\n\\n2. Under the Administration\\'s plan, what entities will be the \\nholders of the \"keys\" to decrypt scrambled data?  What \\nprocedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to \\ndesignate such key holders?\\n\\n3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the \\nAdministration contain a \"trap door\" or \"back door,\" which \\ncould allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to \\ncrack the code?\\n\\n4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used \\nfor communications will require new techniques and additional \\nequipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid \\nadvancement of telecommunications technology?\\n\\n5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place \\non the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to \\nconsumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard \\nin their equipment?\\n\\n6. What is the Commerce Department\\'s assessment of the \\ncompetitive impact of the Administration\\'s endorsement of the \\n\"clipper chip\" technology on U.S. exports of computer and \\ntelecommunications hardware and software products?\\n\\n   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-\\nof-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any \\nquestions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or \\nKaren Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nEdward J.

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400.

This could be encrypted after\\nthe message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with\\na message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting\\nblock.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*\\nsure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be\\nstronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's\\nunbreakable.\\n \\n   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's\\nto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,\\neither.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your\\npad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your\\nopponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext\\nin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going\\non.\\n \\n   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide\\nwhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use\\nof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about\\nhalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a\\nguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying\\nto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the\\nspoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-\\nsynched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.\\n \\n   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure\\nas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.\\n \\n   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together\\nto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy\\nhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.\\nAny change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess\\nof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?\\n \\n   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random\\nbits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages\\njust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.\\nIn fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed\\nmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about\\nthat.\\n \\n   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the\\none-time pad?\\n \\n   --John Kelsey\\n\",\n",

It would have\\n   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to\\n   \"conventional\" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching\\n   by comets, it\\'s got too many holes in it to count, but at\\n   least it was a good try...\\n\\nSo you have a plausible model for GRB\\'s at astronomical distances?\\nRecent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star\\nhypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for\\nimplausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of\\nmodels.\\n\\nA paper on the possibility of GRB\\'s in the Oort cloud just came\\nthrough the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this\\npaper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject\\nline \\n  get 9304001\\n\\n\\nHere is the abstract of that paper.\\n\\n   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \\\\GRBs puts them\\n   at cosmological distances;\\n   but as long as there is no distance\\n   indicator to these events all possible sources which are\\n   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is\\n   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\\\GRBs\\n   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\\\GRBs\\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\\n\\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \\\\GRBs (the BATSE\\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\\n   between the angular distributions of \\\\GRBs and comets\\' aphelia,\\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\\n   at least to some extent, true variations\\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\\\vov$\\n   test to both distributions.\\n\\n   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\\n   $\\\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D\\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\\n   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\\n   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations\\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\\\sim 800$\\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\\n   Currently,\\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\\n   found for the $\\\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort\\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\\\GRBs.\\n',\n",

Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \\nyou\\'d expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \\n\\nEverything that\\'s been measured about clutch hitting over a period\\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \\nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \\ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \\nprobably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \\nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\\nat casually.

At this point,  many\\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\\nAct.                      \\n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \\nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\\nAmerica back to the Moon.\\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \\nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\\nspring, 1993.\\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\\nby necessity, must choose.                    \\n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \\nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\\nand politicians.\\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\\nSociety).\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n\",\n",

In addition, the power will come\\nfrom a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will\\nbe about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be\\nstrong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the\\nbackground, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.\\n\\nIt would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking\\nin to it.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\tDavid M.

Tate)\\nSubject: MVP \\'92 Revisited\\nKeywords: mlb, 04.20\\nOrganization: Department of Industrial Engineering\\nLines: 93\\n\\nTim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year\\'s Defensive Average\\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\\nperformances, compared to league average.  I\\'ve combined those with my\\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\\n\\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don\\'t know what to do about\\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \\nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \\n\\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.  Let\\'s look National\\nLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.\\n\\n\\tPlayer\\t\\tOffense\\t\\tDefense\\t\\tTotal\\n\\n\\tSandberg\\t  44\\t\\t  32\\t\\t 76\\n\\tBonds\\t\\t  67\\t\\t   3\\t\\t 70\\n\\tWalker\\t\\t  26\\t\\t  26\\t\\t 52\\n\\tJustice\\t\\t  14\\t\\t  33\\t\\t 47\\n\\tDaulton\\t \\t  44\\t\\t  ??\\t\\t 44+?\\n\\tLarkin\\t\\t  36\\t\\t   4\\t\\t 40\\n\\tGrace\\t\\t  13\\t\\t  27\\t\\t 40\\n\\nAs I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.\\nIf you deflate Sandberg\\'s offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you\\nget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\\nwouldn\\'t have been close, but that apparently wasn\\'t the case.  Darren\\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\\nand I couldn\\'t tell you whether that\\'s easy or impossible.  A good case \\ncould be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.\\n\\nMy personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.\\n\\n\\nIn the American League:\\n\\n\\tPlayer\\t\\tOffense\\t\\tDefense\\t\\tTotal\\n\\n\\tVentura\\t\\t  22\\t\\t  34\\t\\t 56\\n\\tMartinez\\t  47\\t\\t  -1\\t\\t 46\\n\\tB.

Also, those\\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\\n\\nOnce again, there\\'s a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\\na guess, folks; I don\\'t think we can do any better than that.\\n\\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\\n\\n\\tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\\n\\nI\\'m a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\\nbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\\nleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\\nnegative defense.\\n\\nFor the record:\\n\\n\\tCarlos Baerga\\t\\t  27\\t\\t  5\\t\\t  32\\n\\tRoberto Alomar\\t\\t  35\\t\\t -2\\t\\t  33\\n\\nForget it; it\\'s a wash.\\n\\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\\nDon Mattingly\\'s defense this past season.

Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

The Twins took two of three games in the series,\\nwith scores as follows:\\n\\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\\n                                        Mil  0\\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \\n\\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\\n                                        MN   8\\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\\n\\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\\n                                        Mil 4\\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\\n                    Sa - Aguilera\\n\\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\\n------------------------------------\\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\\nlook like a true genius.\\n\\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \\ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\\n0-5.\\n\\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \\nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\\nit.\\n\\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\\n\\nGeneral News\\n-------------------------------------\\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\\n\\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \\nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\\n\\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\\n\\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\\n\\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \\nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \\nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\\nrubber on the pick-off move.\\n\\n\\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )\\n\\nAMERICAN WEST         Won  Lost   Pct.

Now, in the days when people had lived in\\nmud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood\\ntechnology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in\\nRuritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until\\nthis point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on\\nsomeone\\'s home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being\\na civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars\\nand watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,\\nwould get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going\\non. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but\\neveryone pretended that this didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nOne day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,\\nsuddenly the police couldn\\'t watch all your actions at will. Things\\nwould go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely\\nprivate.\\n\\nIndignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have\\nvideo cameras installed in every nook and cranny. \"After all\", they\\nsaid, \"with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing\\nvideo cameras doesn\\'t mean that the police get any new capability --\\nthey are just keeping the old one.\"\\n\\nA wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the\\nlives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the\\nmud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that\\nRuritania was a civilized country where not everything that was\\nexpedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it\\nhad been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to\\nsolve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its\\nexpedience. Indeed, \"why have warrants at all\", he asked, \"if we are\\ninterested only in expedience?\"\\n\\nA famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She\\nnoted that people might take photographs of children masturbating\\nshould the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,\\nand the law was passed.\\n\\nSoon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths\\nwhile speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading\\ntheir lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the\\npolice said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their\\nlawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never\\nbefore been allowed to listen in on people\\'s homes, but Dorothy\\nQuisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of\\ncovering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and\\nmutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused\\nof being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one\\nwanted to interfere in people\\'s rights to wear what they liked, so a\\ncompromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with\\nmicrophones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man\\nlamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old\\nlip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were\\ninstalled everwhere.\\n\\nHowever, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent\\ncitizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of\\nthem would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not\\nunderstand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at\\nall times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that\\nthey speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. \"After all\",\\nDorothy Quisling pointed out, \"they might be using the opportunity to\\nspeak in private to mask terrorist activities!\"  Terrorism struck\\nterror into everyone\\'s hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of\\nthis new law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all\\nof this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which\\nall Ruritanians were proud. \"Why\", he asked, \"are we obligated to\\nsacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police\\neasier? There isn\\'t any real evidence that this makes any big dent in\\ncrime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!\"\\n\\nHowever, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law\\nrequired, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a\\nmicrophone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived\\nand took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture\\nwas, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been\\nrecently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene\\nthoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the\\nmajor problems of the new age of plenty and joy.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\noperations costs, he said.\\n\\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\n\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\n\\nApril 26\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\n\\nApril 27\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\n\\nMay 3\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nMay 15\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nJune 7\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\n\\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\\n \\n',\n",

But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 55.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nNixon, O.       34    12    15   .083    .777\\nGrissom, M.     48    18    12   .072    .812\\nJackson, D.     46    13    20   .060    .735\\nLewis, D.       25     8    -6   .029    .596\\nDykstra, L.     25     5    -5   .013    .794\\nDascenzo, D.    10    -5    10   .001    .616\\nFinley, S.      32    -2     2  -.003    .759\\nLankford, R.    39     4   -12  -.007    .844\\nMartinez, D.    21     5   -16  -.017    .660\\nVanSlyke, A.    30    -4   -17  -.040    .846\\nSanders, R.      7   -10    -4  -.059    .759\\nButler, B.       1   -29     5  -.088    .716\\nJohnson, H.      3   -12   -19  -.118    .548\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n.846 VanSlyke\\n.844 Lankford\\n.812 Grissom\\n.794 Dykstra\\n.777 Nixon\\n.759 Finley\\n.759 Sanders\\n.735 Jackson\\n.730 *NL Average*\\n.716 Butler\\n.660 Martinez\\n.616 Dascenzo\\n.596 Lewis\\n.548 Johnson\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nLofton, K.      57    32    17   .220    .947\\nWilson, W.      47    26     0   .125    .787\\nWhite, D.       52    25    28   .119    .812\\nFelix, J.       22     0    32   .063    .713\\nDevereaux, M.   43    16     0   .047    .832\\nMcRae, H.       38    11    -1   .038    .631\\nYount, R.       31     8    -3   .022    .737\\nKelly, R.       13    -6    -3  -.025    .681\\nJohnson, L.     23    -5   -13  -.040    .641\\nGriffey, K.     15    -9   -12  -.052    .844\\nPuckett, K.     13   -13   -15  -.063    .801\\nCuyler, M.       6   -10    -6  -.088    .503\\nGonzalez, J.     0   -21   -15  -.095    .738\\n\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.947 Lofton\\n.844 Griffey\\n.832 Devereaux\\n.812 White\\n.801 Puckett\\n.787 Wilson\\n.738 Gonzalez\\n.737 Yount\\n.713 Felix\\n.709 *AL Average*\\n.681 Kelly\\n.641 Johnson\\n.631 McRae\\n.503 Cuyler\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

WHere are they.\\nOriginator: news@nimaster\\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu\\nOrganization: Princeton University\\nLines: 51\\n\\n\\nI feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\\nBATSE press releases.\\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \\n     \"if you smack two neutron\\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\n\\nRalph Wijers\\n\\n',\n",

The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the\\nnon-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).\\nThe privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY\\nhave something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.\\nIf an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data\\ncarried by a person rather than sending it electronically. \\nThe clipper chip will not change this. \\n\\nThe problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper\\nchip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own\\npolice following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have\\nits own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international\\ntraffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there\\nbe an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?\\n\\nForbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot\\na crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate\\non the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will\\nbe more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase\\nin the next years.\\n\\nI think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the\\nrisk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's\\ncommunications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?\\nI think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done\\nnot only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can\\nhelp reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real\\ndanger and it can be helpful.\\n\\nPh. HOOGVORST\\n\",\n",

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\\n\\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\\nThe first does trade ``quality,\\'\\' in the sense you mention, for heat.\\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone\\'s habitual velocity, friends,\\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\\n\\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \\ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone\\'s\\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can\\'t haul my\\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\\nto my use and flamage in general.\\n\\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\\napplicable.  You also probably couldn\\'t outrun a tennis ball with a\\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I\\'ll bet you and your \\nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a\\nFault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal\\ntelemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34\\nmeter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into\\nContingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry\\nindicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers\\nreported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes\\nwere reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and\\nAACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These\\nreadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM\\nyesterday, 4/29/93.

However, the Flight Team will be\\ndetermining the precise cause over the next few days.\\n\\nAs of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial\\nReference and was stable in that mode.

MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape\\nRecorders 2 and 3.

The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart\\nC9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacks\\nbetween  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5-\\n5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.

As far as commercialization, that is\\n>a long ways off.  ...\\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space\\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\nfor future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\\n   It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t\\nthat there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\nthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a\\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor\\n  \\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n',\n",

The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the \\ncrudest of equipment.

Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail\\nto notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist\\nthe throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see\\njust how well she\\'s been put back together.\\n\\n\\tAt 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was\\nflexing a bit.

(But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\n>solutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\n>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens\\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\\n>criteria, then fine.\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\\n>individual\\'s contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only\\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a\\n>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n>The stats are a nice hobby and that\\'s about it.  There is no new\\n>knowledge being produced.  \\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.\\n\\njking\\n\\n',\n",
